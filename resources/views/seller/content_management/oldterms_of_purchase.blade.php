ARJUN EVENTS solely handles the transactions and collects payments for the tickets sold by the “event organizer”.  Therefore, You will be buying your ticket from the “event organizer” while ARJUN EVENTS only acts as the provider of sale services for your purchase.  If you exchange your tickets or purchase tickets by using Exchange Tickets facility services, you buy tickets from either a reseller who is not an event organizer, or ARJUN EVENTS, or the event organizer.  ARJUN EVENTS is only provider of the services for such sales, unless ARJUN EVENTS sells tickets through the Exchange Ticket method.      <br><br>TICKET PRICES ARE SET BY THE “EVENT ORGANIZERS”<br>NOT BY ARJUN EVENTS<br>ARJUN EVENTS acts as the facilitator for sale of tickets and sells tickets for the benefit of the “event organizers “ including; promoters, providers, bands, performers and the venues.  The “event organizers” will set the ticket prices and determine seating arrangements.  ARJUN EVENTS generally is not involved in determining the tickets prices, nor in the seating arrangements or locations of the sold tickets.  Tickets are sold via several distribution centers, including online, information center and retail stores.  ARJUN EVENTS does not control the inventory of the tickets or their availability. Since there is always the possibility that tickets to favorable events sell out very fast, extra tickets could be foreseen and may be available prior to the event but as stressed earlier, ARJUN EVENTS does not control such inventory or its availability.  ARJUN EVENTS also facilitates the resale of tickets and handles relevant transactions on ExchangeTickets .  Please take into consideration the fact that tickets sold through  ARJUN EVENTS’s ExchangeTicket service are often sold at a higher prices than their original prices.  Occasionally, the additional tickets for subsequent distribution may be allocated to, and received by, ARJUN EVENTS or other distributors, centers, which may have higher demands or the same status as the tickets sold on Exchange Ticket, or may be put for sale at a lesser price than the price charged on Exchange Ticket.<br><br>CONFIRMATION NUMBER<br>Please note that if after you submitted the required payment information, you do not receive a confirmation number/ letter, or email, it is your responsibility to confirm with your Customer Section, whether or not your requested order has been placed.
